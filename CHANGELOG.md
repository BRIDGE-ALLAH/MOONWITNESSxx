# Changelog

All notable changes to the RIOTWORKS monorepo will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Product-integrity audit for workspace contracts, navigation truth, and release blockers.
- Runtime rate limiting for ARSY database health and readiness endpoints.
- Persistent accessible prototype/demo disclosure in Headquarter.
- Container build verification for ARSY and Headquarter.
- PostgreSQL-backed account/network login throttling shared across ARSY instances, with fail-closed Headquarter login behavior.
- Asynchronous scrypt-based operator password verification.

### Fixed
- ARSY application owns its build contract instead of delegating HTTP lifecycle to the framework-neutral core.
- Docker images include required workspace build configuration.
- Workspace audit rejects unsafe glob patterns that could traverse outside the repository.
